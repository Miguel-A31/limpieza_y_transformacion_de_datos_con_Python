# 🏡 Airbnb Data Cleaning with Python 🐍

In this project, I focused exclusively on cleaning a publicly available Airbnb dataset, using Python as the primary tool. The goal was to ensure that the data was error-free and ready for subsequent analysis.

## Project Phases:

### 🗂 Initial Dataset Exploration

I started with an initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure and content. I used the pandas and numpy libraries to load the data and obtain basic descriptive statistics. This stage was crucial for identifying potential issues and planning the data cleaning process.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning

* 🔍 **Handling Missing Values:** I identified columns with missing values and applied appropriate strategies, such as imputing with mean or median values, or removing rows/columns when necessary.
* 🛠 **Correcting Data Types:** I ensured that all columns had the correct data type, converting date strings to datetime objects and adjusting other variables as needed.
* ✂️ **Removing Duplicates:** I reviewed and removed duplicate rows to avoid distortions in future analyses.
* 📊 **Handling Outliers:** I detected and managed outliers using statistical methods, such as percentiles, to ensure they did not negatively impact the analysis.

## ✅ Cleaning Validation

I conducted a thorough review to ensure that all cleaning stages had been correctly implemented and that the data was ready for deeper analysis. I checked the consistency and coherence of the data after each cleaning stage.

## 📝 Process Documentation

I documented each step of the cleaning process, providing a clear and detailed record of the actions taken. This included justifying the cleaning decisions and any significant changes made to the data.

This project highlights my ability to perform thorough data cleaning using Python, ensuring that the dataset is error-free and ready for advanced analysis. Data quality is essential for obtaining accurate and reliable insights, and this project demonstrates my competence in ensuring such quality.
